# Laravel-framework-website-demo
I worked on Laravel full-stack web application which aims to integrate with OpenAI API and MySQL. Also, provides statistics with Google Charts.


IN ORDER TO COMPILE THIS example-app YOU SHOULD HAVE LARAVEL AND XAMPP INSTALLED IN YOUR DEVICE!

You should follow to the location in your computer where example-app is downloaded.
After, you should start it like; 'php artisan serve' command.

Then you can open from any browser ; URL -> localhost:8000/mainPage (8000 can be different in your device)
